# WorkFlow_Management_System
•	This project consists of three classes ‘Task’, ‘PriorityQueue’, and ‘WorkflowManager’. 

•	It also includes a print_menu function and a loop to interact with the user.

•	The ‘Task’ class represents a task with attributes such as name, priority, and deadline.

•	The ‘PriorityQueue’ class represents a priority queue and includes methods for inserting tasks into the queue, extracting the task with the highest priority, and maintaining the heap property.

•	The ‘WorkflowManager’ class handles the creation, deletion, updating, and displaying of tasks. It utilizes a priority queue to manage the tasks. The class includes methods for adding a task, deleting a task, searching for a task, updating a task, and displaying all the tasks sorted by priority.

•	The ‘print_menu’ function displays the menu options for the workflow management system.

•	The main part of the code creates an instance of the ‘WorkflowManager’ class and enters a loop to interact with the user. It displays the menu, accepts user input, and calls the appropriate methods based on the user's choice.

•	The complexity analysis for each method is also provided in the comments.

•	Overall, the code provides a workflow management system that allows users to manage tasks by adding, deleting, updating, searching, and displaying them based on priority.
